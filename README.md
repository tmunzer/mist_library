# Description

## Usage

These scripts are using the [mistapi Python package](https://pypi.org/project/mistapi/) to manage the authentication process with the Mist Cloud.
This package can use API Token authentication or Login/Password:

- saved in a `.mist_env` file located in your home folder (see below for the env file description)
- saved in a file and passed with the `-e` or `--env` parameter to the script (see below for the env file description)
- if no env file is found, the script will ask for the Login/Passwd

## Environment File

The environment file can be used to store all the information requested by the scripts. It can be used to easily store and used different environments and automate the execution of the scripts without having to save credential information in the script itself.
| Variable Name | Type | Default | Comment |
| ------------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
MIST_HOST | string | None | The Mist Cloud to use. It must be the "api" one (e.g. `api.mist.com`, `api.eu.mist.com`, ...) |
MIST_APITOKEN | string | None | The API Token to use. |
MIST_USER | string | None | The login to use if no API Token is provided (apitoken use is preferred) |
MIST_PASSWORD | string | None | The password to use if no API Token is provided (apitoken use is preferred) |
CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL | int | 20 | The minimum log level to display on the console, using `logging` schema (0 = Disabled, 10 = Debug, 20 = Info, 30 = Warning, 40 = Error, 50 = Critical) |
LOGGING_LOG_LEVEL | int | 10 | The minimum log level to log on the file, using `logging` schema (0 = Disabled, 10 = Debug, 20 = Info, 30 = Warning, 40 = Error, 50 = Critical). This is only used when the script calling `mistapi` is using Python `logging` package and is configured to log to a file |

An example of the environment file content is:

```
MIST_HOST = api.mist.com
MIST_APITOKEN = xxxxxx
```

# Scripts

The scripts are located in the `scripts` folder. They can be used as-is, or customized if needed.
There is a short description at the beginning of each script explaining the purpose of the script, the available options, and how to use it. They are also accepting the `-h` option which will display the script help.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
Each script has description and documentation at the beginning of the file. Please check this information first, it is providing useful information on how to use each script.
